        <H1>Welcome to Smuggle</H1>
        <P>Smuggle is a free offline MediaWiki browser that allows you to read contents of your favorite wiki offline.</P>
        <H2>How does it work?</H2>
        <P>Smuggle is storing all data from any MediaWiki installation which you want to work with on a local disk. You just
        need to define a link to your favorite wikis using <B>Wiki -&gt; Create link</B>, where you fill in address of a server where
        your favorite wiki is. Once you do that, you can choose <B>Wiki -&gt; Import pages</B> in order to import pages to that wiki.
        The pages you downloaded can be accessed anytime using a menu on side.</P>
